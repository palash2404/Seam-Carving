# Seam Carving Algorithm Implementation

A C implementation of the seam carving algorithm for content-aware image resizing, based on the seminal paper "Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing" by Avidan and Shamir (SIGGRAPH 2007).

## Overview

Seam carving is an algorithm for content-aware image resizing that removes (or adds) pixels in a way that preserves the most important visual content. Instead of traditional scaling that can distort images, seam carving identifies and removes the least noticeable pixel paths (seams) from the image.

## Features

- **Energy Calculation**: Computes pixel importance using gradient-based energy functions
- **Dynamic Programming**: Efficiently finds optimal seams using DP algorithms  
- **Vertical & Horizontal Seams**: Supports both width and height reduction
- **P3 PPM Support: Handles P3 (ASCII) portable pixmap format for image I/O
- **Performance Optimized**: Includes both debug and optimized builds
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with various image scenarios

## Building

```bash
make
```

This creates:
- `bin/carve_debug` - Debug version with sanitizers and debugging symbols
- `bin/carve_opt` - Optimized version for performance
- `bin/testrunner` - Unit test executable

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage - shows image statistics
./bin/carve_opt input.ppm

# Resize image (example - check argparser.h for full options)
./bin/carve_opt -w 400 -h 300 input.ppm

# Run with debug version for development
./bin/carve_debug input.ppm
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
make check

# Run custom tests
make test_all

# List available tests
python3 test/run_tests.py -l

# Run specific test
python3 test/run_tests.py -f [TESTNAME]
```

## Algorithm Overview

1. **Energy Calculation**: For each pixel, calculate energy based on color gradients
2. **Seam Detection**: Use dynamic programming to find minimum energy vertical/horizontal path
3. **Seam Removal**: Remove the seam and shift remaining pixels
4. **Iteration**: Repeat until desired dimensions are reached

## Implementation Highlights

- **Memory Management**: Careful allocation and deallocation in C
- **Performance**: Optimized algorithms with O(n*m) complexity for seam finding
- **Robustness**: Comprehensive error handling and edge case management
- **Code Quality**: Clean, well-documented C code following best practices
- **Testing**: Extensive test coverage including boundary conditions

## Technical Details

### Energy Functions
The implementation uses gradient-based energy functions that measure the rate of color change at each pixel. High-energy pixels (edges, textures) are preserved while low-energy pixels (uniform areas) are candidates for removal.

### Dynamic Programming Approach
Seam detection uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the minimum energy path through the image, ensuring optimal seam selection in linear time.

### Image Format
Works with P3 PPM (Portable Pixmap) format - ASCII text-based variant with human-readable RGB values.
